    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...<br>
    and the sailors looked at the captain with greedy eyes, eyes of mutiny <br>
    they had a plan to take over the ship and steal his treasured candy chest <br>
    by waiting until the old cap fell sound asleep!  When they opened the "candy chest", they discovered a skeleton <br>
    KEY!  Now, they wonder what door this key opens...
